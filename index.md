title: About
---

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), working with [Prof. Tarek Tabdelzaher](http://abdelzaher.cs.illinois.edu/) and [Prof. Josep Torellas](http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/josep/torrellas.html) as a part of the [ACE research center](https://acecenter.grainger.illinois.edu/).
I received my PhD in Computer Engineering from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Virginia (UVA), where I was fortunate to work under the supervision of [Prof. Brad Campbell](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~bjc8c/). I was a member of UVA Engineering [Link Lab](https://engineering.virginia.edu/link-lab).

My research aims to enable green and sustainable computing for ubiquitous sensing in the domain of Internet-of-Things, mobile computing, and wearables. I work at the intersection of  energy-harvesting and intermittent systems, low power embedded systems design, edge machine learning, and wireless sensing. In my research, I look for ways to combine hardware and software systems efficiently to introduce better energy-management as well as novel, accurate, and reconfigurable sensing, empowering sensors embedded in our daily life to enable a sustainable planet.
<!-- She explores and develops computing techniques that involve novel design architectures and end-to-end systems to ensure sustainable operation of devices with decades-long lifetime. -->

<!-- My work aims to enable green and sustainable computing in the domain of cyber-physical systems and Internet-of-Things applications. I design hardware and software techniques to make applications reconfigurable, robust, and resilient when powered from harvested energy. My research takes a step toward enabling sustainable IoT by allowing an energy-harvesting power supply to incorporate sensing, computing,  and processing. -->

Before obtaining my PhD, I received my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://eee.buet.ac.bd/) in 2016.
<!-- I also completed my Masters in Computer Engineering from UVA in 2020. -->

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
