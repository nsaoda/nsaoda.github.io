title: About
---

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Engineering at the University of Virginia (UVA). My Phd research is supervised by [Dr. Brad Campbell](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~bjc8c/).

My work aims to enable green and sustainable computing in the domain of cyber-physical systems and Internet-of-Things applications. I design hardware and software techniques to make applications reconfigurable, robust, and resilient when powered from harvested energy. My research takes a step toward enabling sustainable IoT by allowing an energy-harvesting power supply to incorporate sensing, computing,  and processing.

I am a proud member of [UVA Engineering Link Lab](https://engineering.virginia.edu/link-lab). Before starting my PhD, I received my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://eee.buet.ac.bd/) in 2016. I also completed my Masters in Computer Engineering from UVA in 2020.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
